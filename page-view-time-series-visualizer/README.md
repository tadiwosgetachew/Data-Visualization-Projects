# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project visualizes the daily page view data from **freeCodeCamp.org** forum, spanning from **2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03**, using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to analyze trends and growth patterns over time.

## Description

The project involves cleaning the data and creating visualizations:
- **Line chart**: Shows the overall trend of daily page views.
- **Bar chart**: Displays the **average daily page views** for each month.
- **Box plots**: Present the year-wise and month-wise box plots highlighting yearly trends and seasonal variations.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Dataset used for analysis.
-  `examples`: Test your graphs against with these figures.
- `visualizations/`: Generated charts and figures.
- `notebooks/`: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations code.
- `README.md`: Project details.

## Requirements

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas jupyter
```
## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Please submit a pull request or open an issue to suggest improvements.

## Future Improvements

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Create interactive charts using libraries like Plotly or Dash for better user experience.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implement machine learning models to forecast future page views based on historical data.
- **Enhanced Daily Analysis**: Explore deeper insights into daily page view patterns, such as weekly or hourly trends.
